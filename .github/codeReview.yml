      # Add steps for checking coding standards (linting), analyzing code quality metrics,
      # and scanning for security vulnerabilities using appropriate tools or services.
      # For example, you can use ESLint for linting, CodeClimate for code quality analysis,
      # and Snyk for vulnerability scanning.

      # Example steps for ESLint:
      - name: Install ESLint
        run: npm install eslint --save-dev

      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run eslint

      # Example steps for CodeClimate:
      - name: Install CodeClimate CLI
        run: npm install -g codeclimate-test-reporter

      - name: Run CodeClimate Analysis
        run: codeclimate analyze --dev

      # Example steps for vulnerability scanning with Snyk:
      - name: Install Snyk
        run: npm install -g snyk

      - name: Run Snyk Security Test
        run: snyk test

      # Add steps to provide feedback on pull requests and enforce required checks before merging.
      # This can include commenting on the pull request with analysis results, blocking the merge
      # if certain conditions are not met, etc.

      # Example step to comment on the pull request with analysis results:

            The ESLint analysis found some issues in the code. Please review and address them.

            Snyk Security Test: [Link](insert_link_to_security_test_results)

            Once the issues are resolved, you can proceed with merging.

      # Example step to block the merge if ESLint errors are found:
      - name: Check ESLint Results
        run: |
          # Check ESLint results and exit with non-zero status if errors are found
          # Replace this with appropriate command based on your linting tool
          if grep -q 'error' eslint_output.txt; then
            echo "ESLint found errors. Blocking the merge."
            exit 1
          fi
